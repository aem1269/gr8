            Professors in the gr8ing system are profiles that have
            been assigned to teach a course. The only extra functionality
            that a professor has over a student is that when a professor
            goes to the course information page for a course they are teaching
            they see an enter grades button (if the course has at least one student).
            When clicked a list of students that are enrolled in the course are shown
            with an input field for their grade, the grades can be saved, and then modified again
            if necessary. Professors may enroll in any class they want to and they will be
            treated like a student.

<!-- Begin Admin Section -->
{% if request.user.is_staff %}
<div class="panel panel-primary" id="admin">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        <h2>Admin User Guide</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
            As and Admin of a university using the Gr8ing System<sup>TM</sup>,
            you are given privileged access to functionality that the system
            depends on to exist. Admins can access the Admin dropdown in the header when logged in.
            Admins are responsible for tasks such as

            <ul>
                <li>Creating Users</li>
                <li>Creating Rooms</li>
                <li>Creating Terms</li>
                <li>Creating Creating Course Codes</li>
                <li>Creating Courses</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <h3>Creating Users</h3>
        <p>
            Whenever a new user needs to be added to the system, an admin
            must must create an account for the new user. The admin enters
            the users personal information and creates a user name and password
            for the account. The admin also has to set if the user can enroll 
            in classes, if the checkbox is not checked the user cannot enroll in classes,
            they can just view them and add them to their shopping cart.
            For example if there was a financial hold on the student you would not want 
            them to be able to enroll until the finical hold was resolved.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Rooms</h3>
        <p>
            For classes to actually be held there has to be rooms to hold them in.
            Admins must add every room in which classes are taught to the system. 
            This will be a big effort when the system is new, but once all the rooms
            are entered, they won't have to be entered again. After all the rooms have 
            been entered, the create a room page will not be needed unless a new room
            is added to the university and it needs to be added to the gr8ing system.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Terms</h3>
        <p>
            For the University to be able to hold classes in an organized
            fashion, the define periods of time known as terms. These terms
            have to be entered into the gr8ing system by the Admins so that 
            courses can have a term they belong to. Terms are created by 
            selecting the season and then setting a start and end date for the
            term. 
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Course Codes</h3>
        <p>
            For courses to exist there first has to be course codes in the system.
            Course codes have a code such as "SWEN-261" or "MATH-182" these codes
            are used as an abbreviation for the name of the course which can get
            quite long. When creating a course code the admin also has to set the number
            of credits the course is worth, and they can add any pre-requisites the course 
            code has, for example "SWEN-261" is a pre-req of "SWEN-262". A course
            can have between 0 and 3 pre-reqs so the fields can be left blank.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Courses</h3>
        <p>
            Once the Admins have created course codes, terms and rooms,
            courses can be created. Each course can have 0 to N sections
            and the gr8ing system auto increments the section number as 
            courses with the same course code are created. The professor for the
            class is set to a user in the system, or it can be left blank to 
            leave the professor set as "Staff" if the professor for the class
            has not yet be decided. When creating the course the Admin creates course sessions, 
            which define where and when the course meets. This is done by selecting the
            days of the week, the time (in military time) and the room 
            the course will meet. There can be as many course sessions
            as desired, allowing the course to meet on different days at 
            different times.
